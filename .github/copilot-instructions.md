# Better YouTube Duration Extension Development

This is a Chromium browser extension that enhances YouTube's video player by showing adjusted duration based on playback speed.

## Project Context
- **Type**: Chromium browser extension (Manifest V3)
- **Target**: YouTube video pages
- **Functionality**: Display real video duration adjusted for playback speed when speed â‰  1x
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, MutationObserver

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Follow modern ES6+ syntax
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comprehensive comments for complex logic
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### YouTube Integration
- YouTube uses single-page application architecture
- DOM elements are dynamically loaded and changed
- Use MutationObserver to detect changes
- Handle YouTube's navigation without page reloads
- Test with various video lengths and types

### Extension Best Practices
- Minimize permissions requested
- Use content scripts for DOM manipulation
- Ensure compatibility with Manifest V3
- Handle errors gracefully without breaking YouTube
- Maintain performance with minimal resource usage

### Selectors and DOM
- YouTube frequently changes their CSS classes and DOM structure
- Use multiple selector fallbacks
- Avoid overly specific selectors that might break
- Test on different YouTube layouts (theater mode, mini player, etc.)

### Testing Considerations
- Test with various playback speeds (0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Test with different video durations (short and long videos)
- Test YouTube navigation (playlist navigation, recommended videos)
- Test on different YouTube layouts and themes
- Verify extension doesn't interfere with YouTube's functionality
