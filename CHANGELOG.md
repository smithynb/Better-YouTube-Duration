### üìù How SponsorBlock Integration Works
1. **Detection**: Extension detects if SponsorBlock has modified the duration display

3. **Calculation**: Applies playback speed division to SponsorBlock's duration
4. **Update**: Replaces SponsorBlock's display with speed-adjusted version
5. **Fallback**: Uses original implementation if no SponsorBlock detected

### üéØ Examples
**Without SponsorBlock:**
- 1x speed: `10:30`
- 2x speed: `10:30 (5:15)`

**With SponsorBlock (1:45 of sponsors to skip):**
- 1x speed: `10:30 (8:45)` 
- 2x speed: `10:30 (4:22)` ‚Üê Speed adjustment applied to SponsorBlock duration
