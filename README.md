# Better YouTube Duration

Chromium browser extension that displays the real video duration adjusted for playback speed in YouTube's HTML5 player. 

## How it Works
At playback speed **other than 1x**: 
- Shows real duration of the video (Total Duration / Speed) in parentheses 

When SponsorBlock is installed and has segments to skip **WITH speed other than 1x**:
- Divides duration without sponsor segment by playback speed

## Installation

### For Development/Testing:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome/Chromium and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension will be installed and active on YouTube

### Manual Installation:

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the files to a folder
3. Follow the development installation steps above

## Usage

1. Navigate to any YouTube video
2. Change the playback speed using YouTube's speed controls (click the gear icon â†’ Playback speed)
3. The duration will automatically update to show both original and adjusted times

## Technical Details

### How It Works:
- **Content Script**: Injects into YouTube pages to monitor video elements
- **DOM Observation**: Uses MutationObserver to detect YouTube's dynamic content changes
- **Event Listening**: Monitors `ratechange` events on video elements
- **Duration Calculation**: Calculates adjusted duration as `original_duration / playback_rate`
- **SponsorBlock Integration**: Detects SponsorBlock's duration modifications and applies speed adjustment to them rather than making its own duration label

## Known Problems

1. Does not fully work with SponsorBlock.
