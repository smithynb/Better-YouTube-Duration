# Icon Placeholder Files

This directory should contain the extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (favicon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor. The icons should:
- Be simple and recognizable
- Work well at small sizes
- Represent the extension's function (duration/time related)
- Follow browser extension icon guidelines

### Suggested Design Ideas:
- Clock icon with "YT" text
- Stopwatch with speed indicator
- Duration symbol with YouTube play button
- Timer with adjustable speed indicator

### Online Icon Generators:
- favicon.io
- iconifier.net
- realfavicongenerator.net

## Temporary Solution

For development and testing, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any existing PNG files renamed appropriately
3. The extension will work without icons, though they won't display properly

Replace these placeholder files with actual icons before publishing.
